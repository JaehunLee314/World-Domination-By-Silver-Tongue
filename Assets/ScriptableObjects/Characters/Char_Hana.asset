  lore: "Childhood friend of the player. You came to Tokyo together from a remote
    village. A \"Country Bumpkin Girl in Tokyo\" (Inaka-musume). Age 24, unemployed.
    Fashion: Terrible - faded green t-shirts over old-fashioned jeans. Messy hair
    with a cheap baseball cap. Desperate, loud, and easily flustered. Recently fired
    via a LINE stamp by an AI HR manager. Terrified of being forced to go back to
    the village as a \"Tokyo Failure.\" Has infinite stamina and a \"Never-say-die\"
    country spirit. Speaks with heavy country dialect, emotional and high-pitched
    when excited."
